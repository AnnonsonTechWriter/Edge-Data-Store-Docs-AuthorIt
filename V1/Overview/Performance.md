# Performance

Edge Data Store is designed to run on a variety of small hardware and software platforms, and to support running customer applications on the same platform. In order to assist in determining the
correct hardware and software configuration for a specific use, testing has been done with the Edge Data Store on a variety of different hardware platforms with the supported ingress protocols at different event rates. Summary tables are provided below for each of the different
protocols on different hardware platforms. 

Mean and Maximum CPU use and Memory (Working Set) are provided. The values are averaged over one minute for the maximum computations, so it is possible there may be momentary spikes in memory or CPU use. These tables are provided as an approximate guideline to what might be expected
as an Edge Data Store platform is designed. It is strongly recommended that before production 
deployment of Edge Data Store performance testing is conducted.
