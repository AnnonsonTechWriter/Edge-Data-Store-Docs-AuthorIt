# Quick start guides
The quick start guides in this section provide basic instructions to get started with Edge Data Store, its components and utilities.  Each quick start guide provides guidance for setup, configuration and basic operation. Refer to the respective configuration sections for detailed instructions on each EDS component or utility.

The examples in each quick start guide use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure Edge Data Store components with the EdgeCmd utility. To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.

All quick start guide examples also assume Edge Data Store has been installed, and is accessible through a REST API using the default installed port (5590).
