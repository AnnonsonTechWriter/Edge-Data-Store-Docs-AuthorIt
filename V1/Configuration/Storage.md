# Storage

The EDS storage component provides Sequential Data Store (SDS) storage, with a rich array of functionality available through REST APIs. For the storage component, you configure [storage runtime](xref:storageruntime), [logging](xref:LoggingConfiguration), and [data egress](xref:configureEgress).

For more information, see [SDS reference](sdsOverview).

The following diagram depicts the relationships between Edge Data Store functions and the EDS Storage component:
