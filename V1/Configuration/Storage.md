# Storage

The EDS storage component provides Sequential Data Store (SDS) storage, with a rich array of functionality available through REST APIs. The storage component has three configurable facets:

- [Storage Runtime](xref:storage_Runtime_schema)

- [Storage Periodic Egress Endpoints](xref:storage_PeriodicEgressEndpoints_schema)

- [Logging](xref:Storage_Logging_schema)

For more information, see [Sequential Data Store](xref:sdsOverview).
