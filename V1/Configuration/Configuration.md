# Configuration

You configure each functional area of Edge Data Store to define connectivity and system behavior appropriate to your particular use case. The topics contained in this section provide instructions for each area. 

The examples in the Configuration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure Edge Data Store components with the EdgeCmd command line utility. To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device. 

For more information on tools for Edge Data Store configuration, see [Configuration tools](xref:managementTools).
