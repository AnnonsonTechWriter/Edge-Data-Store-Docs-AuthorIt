# Administration

Reset EDS adapters, the EDS Storage component, and the Edge Data Store application with the EDS administration level functions.

The examples in the following administration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. The same operations can be performed with the EdgeCmd command line utility or with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. For a partial list of REST tools, see [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools). If available on your device, use a browser to complete data retrieval steps (GET commands) to validate successful configurations.
