# Administration

You can reset EDS adapters, the EDS Storage component, and the Edge Data Store application with the EDS administration level functions.

The examples in the administration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also execute Edge Data Store administration functions with the EdgeCmd command line utility. To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.
