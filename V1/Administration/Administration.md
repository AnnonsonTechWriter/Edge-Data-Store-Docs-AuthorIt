# Administration

Reset EDS adapters, the EDS Storage component, and the Edge Data Store application with the EDS administration level functions.

The examples in the administration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. For a partial list of REST tools, see [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools). You can also execute Edge Data Store administration functions with the EdgeCmd command line utility. If available on your device, use a browser to complete data retrieval steps (GET commands) to validate successful configurations.
